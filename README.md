# Business Focus & Metrics
**The business goals**

There are 2 business goals:

- to predict which recipes will be with high traffic;

- to predict the "High" value of traffic of the recipes with 80% probability.

The Logistic Regression model has achieved both goals, because it has high rates of Precision, Recall and F1 Score are more or equal 80%.


## Business Recommendations
- To aid the Product Manager in predicting recipe traffic, deploying the Logistic Regression Model in production can ensure approximately 84% accuracy in identifying high-traffic recipes. This will instill confidence in the Product Manager to drive more traffic to the website. Additionally, the Product Manager can consider the following strategies:
- Personalized Meal Plans: Utilize nutritional data to create personalized meal plans based on individual preferences and dietary needs.
- Promote Popular Categories: Emphasize and expand promotion of popular recipe categories, particularly chicken recipes, by introducing new and innovative options to maintain customer engagement.
- To focus marketing efforts, target high-traffic recipe categories like Potato, Pork, and Vegetable.
Additionally, optimize serving size options by aligning them with customer preferences and highlighting recipes that cater to popular serving sizes, such as 4 servings.

# Recommendations for future actions
To help Product Manager predict the high traffic of the recipes, we can deploy this Logistic Regression Model into production. By implementing this model, about 81% of the prediction will make sure the traffic will be high. This will help Product Manager build their confidence in generating more traffic to the rest of the website.

**To implement and improve the model, I will consider the following steps:**

- Looking for best ways to deploy this model in terms of performance and costs. The ideal way is to deploy this machine learning model on edge devices for its convenience and security and test the model in newly hired product analysts.
- Collecting more data, e.g. time to make, cost per serving, ingredients, site duration time (how long users were at the recipe page), income links (from what sites users came to the recipe page), combinations of recipes (what recipes user visited at the same session with the current recipe).
- Feature Engineering, e.g increase number of values in category, create more meaningful features from the variables.
